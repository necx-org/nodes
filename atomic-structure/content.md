# Radioactive Decay
## Learning objective
Reproduce a shell model of an atom

### Overview
The most straightforward concept of the atom is the shell model, first proposed by Niels Bohr.

A nucleus contains protons and neutrons. Protons carry a positive charge, and neutrons carry no charge. The nucleus is surrounded by shells of negatively-charged electrons.
Each shell can only hold a fixed number of electrons, and each shell essentially represents a principal energy level. The electrons orbit around the nucleus. 

(Quantum physics has shown this is more of an electron cloud, and there is a limit to how precise one can simulataneously know the position or momentum of a particle; aka the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. For now though, we are only concerned with the Bohr shell model.)

Radioactive decay, therefore, is the spontaneous emission of different particles from an unstable (energy state) atom. This can be the emission of an electron, for example. The atom wants to achieve a stable state, but in the process may become charged due to the method of decay. Radioactivity then refers to the energy emitted as a result of decay.

### Example
The calcuim atom contains 20 protons and 20 neutrons.

Each electron shell is label by its principal quantum number; e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., with the lower number closer to the nucleus.
