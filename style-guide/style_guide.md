# Style Guide
### Nodes
#### Metadata
Metadata is stored in an info.yml file in the parent directory. See the documentation for requirements. 

#### Content
Content files for each node contain the lecture material for the subject matter. See the documentation for node requirements. The content file should be named 'content.md' and be a pure markdown file, so that it can be rendered into different formats. 

Syntax for the file should adhere to the following guidelines:
1. No html tags
2. Use latex tags for equations; i.e., $e^{-\lambda t}$ or $$e^{-\lambda t}$$
3. Images should be stored in an img subdirectory within the parent node directory
